Ryerson Capstone Project
Social media, more specifically tweeter is a powerful medium where almost anyone can take advantage to express
their thoughts and opinions or promote a personal brand unrestrained. 

The purpose of this project is to find out, through Text Classification analysis trending ideas, views and concerns
of residents of five well established Toronto neighbourhoods. The information was collected from tweets from the selected
neighbourhoods, the tweets will be analysed by performing Text Classification, machine Learning and Natural Processing techniques.
The project analyses tweets concerning Toronto’s hot and volatile housing market and the role played by real estate agents.
 
The goal is to pattern tweets with the task of identifying opinions and most frequently used words within the five Toronto areas
and to find out what and where are the most popular opinions. The data is extracted from tweets in the Toronto neighbourhoods
known as East York, Etobicoke, North York, Downtown Toronto and High Park.

The technique is text mining for data exploration, then it will use two text classification methods such as Naïve Bayes Classification 
NBC and Kernel Support Vector Machine KSVM to build the model. It will compare both classification methods to find out which one
performs better. The tool to be used will be R programming language.
